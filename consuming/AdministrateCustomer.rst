CustomerAdministration
======================

.. important::
   To place an order you need the  `GraphQL Storefront module
   <https://github.com/OXID-eSales/graphql-storefront-module/>`_ installed and activated.

The Storefront module comes with all queries and mutations to create and maintain a customer account.
    * Customer Registration
    * Customer account data update (password/email change, setting /changing of invoice address , create/remove delivery address)
    * Forgotten password recovery
    * Subscribe/unsubscribe for newsletter
    * Contact
    * And of course queries to get information about your own account

To create a customer account, we start with

.. code-block:: graphql
   :caption: call to ``customerRegister`` mutation

    mutation customerRegister {
        customerRegister (
            customer: {
                email: "newuser@oxid.de",
                password: "password",
            }
        ) {
            id
            email
        }
    }

.. code-block:: json
   :caption: ``customerRegister`` mutation response

    {
        "data": {
            "customerRegister": {
                "id": "9a2a70af72bfe20b64413d6ad15a4256",
                "email": "newuser@oxid.de"
            }
        }
    }


Once you have this 'naked' account created, you need to identify with a JWT to
access and further update your account

.. code-block:: graphql
   :caption: call to ``token`` query

    query token {
        token(
            username: "newuser@oxid.de"
            password: "password"
        )
    }

.. code-block:: json
   :caption: ``token`` query response

    {
        "data": {
            "token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsImlzcyI6Imh0dHA6Ly9sb2NhbGhvc3QubG9jYWwvIn0.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwOi8vbG9jYWxob3N0LmxvY2FsLyIsImF1ZCI6Imh0dHA6Ly9sb2NhbGhvc3QubG9jYWwvIiwiaWF0IjoxNjUzNDgwMjI4LjIyMjQwOCwibmJmIjoxNjUzNDgwMjI4LjIyMjQwOCwiZXhwIjoxNjUzNTA5MDI4LjIyNzkwNSwic2hvcGlkIjoxLCJ1c2VybmFtZSI6InVzZXJAb3hpZC1lc2FsZXMuY29tIiwidXNlcmlkIjoiZTdhZjFjM2I3ODZmZDAyOTA2Y2NkNzU2OThmNGU2YjkiLCJ1c2VyYW5vbnltb3VzIjpmYWxzZSwidG9rZW5pZCI6Ijc5ZTEwMjVjNjJhOWFiNTY2YzZmMzdlYzliMDlhYjJlIn0.JrfP112Th23o4sPB22w7Bq0eYISy_9A7zvYmjOMcvqcBpyt5QibeBSPUCtk2-PFLJ2bWZwGepDOG-gy8-cLunw"
        }
    }

Send this token in every request to the API in the Authorization header (Bearer <JWT>) where it is
necessary to be logged in and be identifiable as the current customer.

Here are some examples how to update the birthday date, set the invoice address and create a delivery address.

.. code-block:: graphql
   :caption: call to ``customerBirthdateUpdate`` mutation

    mutation customerBirthdateUpdate {
        customerBirthdateUpdate ( birthdate: "2001-04-01") {
            email
            birthdate
        }
    }

.. code-block:: json
   :caption: ``customerBirthdateUpdate`` mutation response

    {
        "data": {
            "customerBirthdateUpdate": {
                "email": "newuser@oxid.de",
                "birthdate": "2001-04-01T00:00:00+02:00"
            }
        }
    }


.. code-block:: graphql
   :caption: call to ``customerInvoiceAddressSet`` mutation

    mutation customerInvoiceAddressSet {
        customerInvoiceAddressSet (
            invoiceAddress: {
                salutation: "MRS"

    }

    {

.. code-block:: graphql
   :caption: call to ``customerDeliveryAddressAdd`` mutation

    mutation customerDeliveryAddressAdd {
        customerDeliveryAddressAdd (
            deliveryAddress: {
                salutation: "MRS"
                firstName: "Jane"
                lastName: "Dodo"

                "fax": "555"
            }
        }
    }

Now we can query the customer details. Don't foget to send the JWT, a customer can only query
its own information.

.. code-block:: graphql
   :caption: call to ``customerDetails`` query

    query customerDetails {
        customer {
            id
            email
            customerNumber
            newsletterStatus {
                status
            }
            invoiceAddress {
                salutation
                firstName
                lastName
                street
                company
                streetNumber
                zipCode
                city
                country {
                    isoAlpha2
                }
            }
            deliveryAddresses {
                id
                city
            }
            orders {
                id
                orderNumber
            }
        }
    }

.. code-block:: json
   :caption: ``customerDetails`` query response

    {
        "data": {
            "customer": {
                "id": "9cc65d910c7b385ad004d4eac21fa040",
                "email": "newuser@oxid.de",
                "customerNumber": "8",
                "newsletterStatus": {
                    "status": "UNSUBSCRIBED"
                },
                "invoiceAddress": {
                    "salutation": "MRS",
                    "firstName": "Jane",
                    "lastName": "Doe",
                    "street": "Bertoldstrasse",
                    "company": "Some GmbH",
                    "streetNumber": "48",
                    "zipCode": "79098",
                    "city": "Freiburg",
                    "country": {
                        "isoAlpha2": "DE"
                    }
                },
                "deliveryAddresses": [
                    {
                        "id": "e71cd1bf4f292f70862a3cf1121a72a8",
                        "city": "Bremen"
                    }
                ],
                "orders": []
            }
        }
    }

To reset a forgotten password, you need to use the following mutations:

1. ``customerPasswordForgotRequest``: This mutation sends an email to the customer with a link for password reset,
the same as they would receive if using this functionality from the shop's frontend. The link contains
a unique hash for password reset. This hash key can be found as the ``uid`` parameter of the  password reset link.
The hash will need to be passed as an ``updateHash`` parameter in the ``customerPasswordReset`` mutation.

.. code-block:: graphql
   :caption: call to ``customerPasswordForgotRequest`` mutation

    mutation {
        customerPasswordForgotRequest(email: "customer@example.com")
    }

.. code-block:: json
   :caption: customerPasswordForgotRequest mutation response

    {
        "data": {
            "customerPasswordForgotRequest": true
        }
    }

Returns a boolean indicating if the email was sent successfully.

2. ``customerPasswordReset``: This mutation allows the customer to reset their password using the unique hash sent in the email.

.. code-block:: graphql
   :caption: call to customerPasswordReset mutation

    mutation {
        customerPasswordReset(
            updateHash: "7cd138fe6d558234af927f2fc6764280"
            newPassword: "newSecurePassword123"
            repeatPassword: "newSecurePassword123"
        )
    }

.. code-block:: json
   :caption: customerPasswordReset mutation response

    {
        "data": {
            "customerPasswordReset": true
        }
    }

Returns a boolean indicating if the password was reset successfully.

By default, the hash key is included in the password reset link sent via email. However, you can customize the email
content to include the hash key separately.

Here is and example how to include the hash key separately in your email template:

.. code-block:: html
   :caption: email template example

    <p>Click the following link to reset your password:</p>
    <a href="https://example.com/index.php?cl=forgotpwd&uid={{ user.getUpdateId }}&lang=0&shp=1">Reset Password</a>

    <p>Or you can use the following hash key:</p>
    <p>Hash Key: {{ user.getUpdateId }}</p>

By including ``{{ user.getUpdateId }}`` in your email template, you ensure that the unique hash key is added
to the email content, allowing customers to manually use the hash key if needed.
