OXID implements GraphQL modules to provide an alternative to REST and SOAP web APIs for frontend development. At this stage there are two GraphQL modules available:

    - `GraphQL Base <https://github.com/OXID-eSales/graphql-base-module>`_ (provides a basic `GraphQL <https://www.graphql.org>`_ implementation for the `OXID eShop <https://www.oxid-esales.com/>`_)
    - `GraphQL Catalogue <https://github.com/OXID-eSales/graphql-catalogue-module>`_ (provides `GraphQL <https://www.graphql.org>`_ queries and mutations for the `OXID eShop <https://www.oxid-esales.com/>`_, allowing access to the catalogue view)
